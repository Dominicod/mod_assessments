# Mod Assessments

This is a library of the technical challenges I had to complete in a time limit during my time at Turing. 
This was indepentedly evaluated by instructures in a live coding enviroment.

## Project technology

This project is running the following languages and tools:

* Ruby
* RSpec

## What I learned

With these assements I have learned how to work under pressure with a time limit or deadline of completion. This also helped me stream
line my problem solving process as well as my TDD strategies to maximize efficiency.
